            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is system that allows users to recall specific files over time by recording changes made to the files. For example, if you were a graphic designer, you would use a Version Control System to store every version of an image or layout because it would allow you to revert certain files back to a previous state, the entire file back to a previous state, or even compare changes over time. This is vital to our course because when we make changes to a website it will be very useful to have a system that stores all of our information. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git History</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a software created by the Linux development community that is very efficient with large projects, and has an outstanding branching system for non-linear development. This program was created after the Linux development team's relationship with BitKeeper diminished and the developers needed their own software that was faster, simpler, and could support larger projects like the one the development team was working on. It is relevant to our class becuase we are using the Git software in our web application development process. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is essentially a Version Control System (VCS) that differs from others of its kind because of the way it processes its data. Git views its data like a series of snapchots of a miniature filesystem where each time you save the project, the system will take a screenshot of what your files look like and store it in its memory. Additionally,nearly every operation in the system is local because it stores these screenshots on your local database. Git also has integrity becuase it is impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it. THis means no files can become corrupt or lost without Git detecting this happening.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">How to get a Git repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two ways to create a Git repository, one of which being cloning an existing Git repository. The other way to obtain a Git repository is to take a local directory that is currently not under version control and turn it into a Git repository. You must use the command "$ git init" to create a new subdirectory that contains all of your necessary repository files. This is relevant to our class because we use a Git repository in Cloud9 when we are programming.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GitHub Configuration</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">If you would like to use SSH remotes in the VCS, you need to configure a public key by opening up your settings in GitHub. From there, you should click to add an SSH key and then paste the contents of your public-key file into the text area. After this has been completed, your SSH key should be registered and connected to bath databases. This is relevant to our class because we used SSH keys to configure our public key in cloud9. </p>
